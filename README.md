# Linear-Classifers-and-Neural-Networks
Implementation of basic linear classifiers and classifers with neural networks using supervisied learning.

This project consists of two parts, the first part is basic linear classifer that classifies input data either to be attributed with earthquake or explosion.
This classifer uses gradient descent algorithm with closed-form weight update laws. The second part implements the same classifer using neural networks and 
back propagation algorithm to correct weights for classification errors.
